# This script runs pretty-quick and rustfmt on staged files before committing. It is intended to be used as a pre-commit
# hook. We want to run pretty-quick first, so that it handles formatting of macro lines in rust code, but we use rustfmt
# on top of it to use standard rust formatting for the rest of the rust code.

# Store staged rust files for later use in rustfmt as pretty-quick might revert some changes
