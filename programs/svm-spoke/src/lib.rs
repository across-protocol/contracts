///
/// Spoke pool implementation for Across Protocol enabling connection to the Solana Ecosystem. Program is functionally
/// the re-implementation of SpokePool.sol for Solana, with some extensions to be Solana compatible. The implementation
/// leverages Circle's CCTP for message and token bridging back and forth from Ethereum mainnet. As the EVM spoke pool,
/// this spoke pool is instructed by the EVM hubpool for pool rebalancing and relayer repayment.
