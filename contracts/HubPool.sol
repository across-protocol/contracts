/**
 * @notice Contract deployed on Ethereum that houses L1 token liquidity for all SpokePools. A data worker can interact
 * with merkle roots stored in this contract via inclusion proofs to instruct this contract to send tokens to L2
 * SpokePools via "pool rebalances" that can be used to pay out relayers on those networks. This contract is also
 * responsible for publishing relayer refund and slow relay merkle roots to SpokePools.
 * @notice This contract is meant to act as the cross chain administrator and owner of all L2 spoke pools, so all
 * governance actions and pool rebalances originate from here and bridge instructions to L2s.
 * @dev This contract should be deprecated by the year 2106, at which point uint32 timestamps will roll over. This is
 * an issue for this contract because fee calculations will become bizarre when multiplying by negative time deltas.
 * Before this date, this contract should be paused from accepting new root bundles and all LP tokens should be
 * disabled by the admin.
