 * function which must be implemented in contracts which inherit this contract is `withdrawToken`. It is up to that function
 * to determine which bridges to use for an input L2 token. Importantly, that function must also verify that the L2 to L1
 * token mapping is correct so that the bridge call itself can succeed.
